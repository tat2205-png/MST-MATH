# OpenClaw Extension — Quick Summary

A VS Code sidebar companion for OpenClaw that lets you chat with your codebase, run security hardening, manage tools, and connect to the gateway.

## What It Does

- **Chat** — talk to an AI agent about your code, scoped to your workspace. Each message runs an ephemeral `acpx exec` session.
- **Slash commands** — `/explain`, `/fix`, `/review`, `/test`, `/refactor`, `/doc`, `/commit`, `/harden`, `/search`. Each injects the right editor context automatically.
- **`@`-mention files** — type `@` in the input to search and attach workspace files.
- **Recommendation chips** — context-aware suggestions that appear before the first message, updating as you change editors and selections.
- **Status bar** — shows connection state (idle / connecting / connected / error). Click to run your OpenClaw CLI command.
- **Overview panel** — tree view with Getting Started, Operate, Hardening, Tools, and Help sections.
- **Security hardening** — run `openclaw security audit`, `--fix`, and `--deep` in sequence, plus a plain-English access summary.
- **Tool management** — list, enable/disable, and uninstall tools read from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.
- **Model Setup Wizard** — run onboarding, pick a provider, open config/auth files.
- **Guided install** — detects missing Node.js or OpenClaw CLI and offers install actions.
- **Legacy migration** — prompts to upgrade from `molt` / `clawdbot` to `openclaw`.

## The Simplest Path

1. Install the CLI: `npm install -g openclaw@latest`
2. Install acpx: `npm install -g acpx`
3. Onboard: `openclaw onboard --install-daemon`
4. Open the OpenClaw sidebar and start chatting, or click the status bar item to connect.

- **OpenClaw: Harden** — security hardening workflow
